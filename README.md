The Network-Security-Prediction project leverages machine learning to predict potential security threats in network traffic. By analyzing network data, the system classifies whether the traffic is normal or potentially malicious, offering valuable insights for organizations looking to safeguard their networks. It uses data preprocessing techniques and a trained model to make predictions based on incoming network traffic data.

This project is designed for cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and organizations seeking automated solutions to identify and mitigate network security threats before they escalate. It helps in real-time monitoring of network traffic, making it easier to detect abnormal patterns that could indicate cyber-attacks

## Features

- **CSV File Upload**: Users can upload CSV files for prediction.
- **Prediction Results**: Displays the results of predictions on uploaded data.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Optionally stores prediction results in a MongoDB database.
- **Web Interface**: Simple, user-friendly web interface to interact with the model.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Uses pre-trained model to make real-time predictions.
- **Error Handling**: Handles common file errors and prediction failures gracefully.
- **Model Retraining**: Allows for periodic retraining of the model with updated data.
- **Cross-platform Support**: Accessible on any platform with a modern web browser.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark mode for the web interface.
## Demo

Since this project is API-based, the demo showcases how to interact with the API using tools like **Postman** or **cURL** for sending requests and receiving predictions.

1. **Uploading a CSV File for Prediction**:
   - Use the `POST /predict` API endpoint to upload a CSV file containing network data.
   - The response will include predictions for each data entry.

2. **Retrieving Predictions**:
   - Example API response: 
     ```json
     {
       "predictions": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
       "status": "success",
       "message": "Predictions completed successfully."
     }
     ```

3. **Storing Prediction Results**:
   - The results can be stored in **MongoDB** (optional), which can be viewed or accessed via MongoDB clients.

### Example Demo Using cURL

You can run the following command to test the API:
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/predict' \
  -F 'file=@yourfile.csv' 
  ```

## Usage/Examples

### Making a Prediction Request

To make a prediction using the API, follow this example:

1. **Upload a CSV File for Prediction**

   Use the `/predict` endpoint to upload a CSV file and receive predictions.

   ```python
   import requests

   # Replace with the correct URL if running on a different server
   url = "http://localhost:8000/predict"

   # Upload your CSV file for prediction
   with open("path_to_your_file.csv", "rb") as file:
       response = requests.post(url, files={"file": file})

   # Display the response
   if response.status_code == 200:
       print("Prediction Results:", response.json())
   else:
       print("Prediction failed:", response.text)
    ```

2 .**Training the Model**

Use the /train endpoint to start the training pipeline.
## Environment Variables

Set Up Environment Variables Create a .env file to add your MongoDB URL and other environment variables:

    MONGO_DB_URL=your_mongo_db_url
## API Reference

#### Train Model

```http
  GET /train
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `None` | `N/A` |  This endpoint does not require any parameters. |

#### Get item

```http
  POST /predict
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `file`      | `UploadFile` | **Required**. A CSV file containing data for which predictions are needed. Ensure the file matches the model's expected input columns. |



## Optimizations

1. **Efficient Model Loading:** Reduced prediction latency by loading the model and preprocessor once during startup, instead of on each request.

2. **Data Handling:** Optimized memory usage by processing large CSV files in chunks and using vectorized operations for faster feature scaling.

3. **Asynchronous API:** Used FastAPIâ€™s asynchronous capabilities for concurrent prediction handling, improving response times during high traffic.

4. **Database Optimization:** Implemented MongoDB indexing and bulk insertions to speed up database operations and reduce overhead.

5. **Docker Setup:** Streamlined Dockerfile for efficient deployment, minimizing resource usage and ensuring consistent environments.

6. **Security:** Secured sensitive data through environment variables, preventing credential exposure.
